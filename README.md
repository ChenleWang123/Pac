## üîç Project Origin & Modifications

This project is **based on the original implementation by [Jmansford](https://github.com/jmansford)**.  
Building upon his foundation, **additional features and improvements** were implemented to enhance both the gameplay and reinforcement learning experiments.

### üß† New Features Added
1. **Accelerate Mode** ‚Äì Allows Pacman or ghosts to temporarily move faster.  
2. **Freeze Mode** ‚Äì Temporarily freezes ghost movement for strategic advantage.  
3. **Invisible Mode** ‚Äì Makes Pacman invisible to ghosts, testing AI perception and robustness.  
4. **Completed Reinforcement Learning (RL) training** ‚Äì Fully trained DQN agents and tuned reward shaping mechanisms for improved performance.

## üïπÔ∏è Project Overview

This project implements a Pacman game environment where the player (Pacman) can be controlled by either:
1. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) trained through reinforcement learning
2. A Behavioural Cloning model trained through imitation learning

The goal is to compare the performance and learning characteristics of these two different approaches to game AI.

### Human Mode Controls
- `‚Üë`: Move up  
- `‚Üì`: Move down  
- `‚Üê`: Move left  
- `‚Üí`: Move right

### New Special Abilities
- `F`: Activate **Freeze Mode** (ghosts stop moving temporarily)  
- `I`: Activate **Invisible Mode** (Pacman becomes invisible to ghosts)  
- `X`: Activate **Accelerate Mode** (Pacman moves faster)

### Game Management
- `M`: Switch between Simple and Complex maze  
- `SPACE`: Restart game (when game over or won)

### Demonstration Recording (when `RECORD_DEMONSTRATIONS = True`)
- `R`: Start recording demonstration (in HUMAN mode)
- `T`: Stop recording demonstration
- `C`: Cancel current recording
- `A`: Analyse all recorded demonstrations
